# üìä Regression Projects with Matplotlib Visualizations

This repository contains a collection of regression-based machine learning projects built in Python using **VS Code**. All projects focus on **predictive modeling using regression techniques**, and include **data visualization** with **Matplotlib** to support Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and interpretation of model performance.
